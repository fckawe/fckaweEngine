<p>This is just a small project to discover java game programming. fckaweEngine aims to be a base library for simple java desktop games. The idea is to use as few a possible external libraries. To be less dependent and to learn more.</p>

<h3>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>At the moment the library is under construction. There's still a lot to be done. A first complete version should cover things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>configuration handling</li>
<li>console logging</li>
<li>optimized FPS logic</li>
<li>basic bitmap blitting</li>
<li>basic custom fonts</li>
<li>sprites with some basic physics</li>
<li>collision detection (simple boundaries and pixel perfect)</li>
<li>keyboard input handling</li>
<li>simple sound output</li>
<li>tile based levels (and maybe a level editor)</li>
<li>simple menu navigation</li>
<li>internationalized user interface (english, german, maybe spanish)</li>
</ul><h3>

<p>Some of the interesting things I learned got packed into an article on my blog "<a href="http://mamu.backmeister.name">ME and my U</a>". And I hope more articles will follow.
It's a blog about Ubuntu and Linux in general and even more generally open source software. I won't write about Java programming topics, I think, but hints about how to create game music, graphics, fonts and thing like that. Ahhh, almost forgot to mention, that it's a blog in german language... :/</p>
