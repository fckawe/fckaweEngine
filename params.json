{"name":"fckaweEngine","tagline":"some exercises in Java game programming","body":"### Welcome to fckaweEngine\r\nThis is just a small project to discover java game programming. fckaweEngine aims to be a base library for simple java desktop games. The idea is to use as few a possible external libraries. To be less dependent and to learn more.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nFirst it should cover things like:\r\n* configuration handling\r\n* console logging\r\n* optimized FPS logic\r\n* basic bitmap blitting\r\n* basic custom fonts\r\n* sprites with some basic physics\r\n* collision detection (simple boundaries and pixel perfect)\r\n* keyboard input handling\r\n* simple sound output\r\n* tile based levels (and maybe a level editor)\r\n* simple menu navigation\r\n* internationalized user interface (english, german, maybe spanish)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
