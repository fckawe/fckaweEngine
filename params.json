{"name":"fckaweEngine","tagline":"some exercises in Java game programming","body":"### Welcome to fckaweEngine\r\nThis is just a small project to discover Java game programming. fckaweEngine aims to be a base library for simple Java desktop games. The idea is to use as few a possible external libraries. To be less dependent and to learn more.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nAt the moment the library is under construction. There's still a lot to be done. A first complete version should cover things like:\r\n* configuration handling\r\n* console logging\r\n* optimized FPS logic\r\n* basic bitmap blitting\r\n* basic custom fonts\r\n* sprites with some basic physics\r\n* collision detection (simple boundaries and pixel perfect)\r\n* keyboard input handling\r\n* simple sound output\r\n* tile based levels (and maybe a level editor)\r\n* simple menu navigation\r\n* internationalized user interface (english, german, maybe spanish)\r\n\r\n### Contact me\r\nIf you have hints or other helping feedback don't hestitate to contact me via my profile on GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Read my Blog!\r\nSome of the interesting things I learned got packed into articles on my blog \"[ME and my U](http://mamu.backmeister.name)\". And I'm confident that more articles will follow in the future.\r\nIt's a blog about Ubuntu and Linux in general and even more generally about open source software. I won't write about Java programming topics, I think, but hints about how to create game music, graphics, fonts and thing like that. Ahhh... almost forgot to mention, that it's a blog in german language... :/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
